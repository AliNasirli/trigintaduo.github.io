        <h1><i>Information About Our Website Project</i></h1>
        <p class="webinfop">Team 32 is responsible for the creation of this website. In general, we decided to use white and grey colors for our website in order to make it look minimalistic and to make visitors feel calm so that they may use it when it is dark conditions. In addition, we have separated our website into its three primary sections—Hour of Code, About Us, and Website Project; to make it easier for users to locate the information they require in a timely and effective manner. HTML and CSS are the two tools that were important in our team's completion of this process. Farhad Alibayli, a member of our team, put forth a lot of effort to improve his HTML and CSS skills. Team 32's group leader, Ali Nasirli, was primarily responsible for the work done in the areas of general content, organization, and HTML and CSS. Last but not least, Riad Ruhi and Rauf karimli utilized usage their expertise in CSS and HTML in order to embellish and promote towards our website. Courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were completed in CodeAcademy by members of our team so that we could increase our technical abilities and make all the requirements. Additionaly, our logo means 32 in latin language. We decided to use latin words as they're aesthetic. 32 is XXXII in Roman numbers, that is why we designed our logo like this, 3 X's and 2 as II.</p>
