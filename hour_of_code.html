        <h1><i>Hour of Code</i></h1>
        <p>My colleagues (Farhad Alibayli, Rauf Karimli, and Riad Ruhi) and I conducted the #HourOfCode event at Baku Turkish (Dayanat Foundation) High School. The primary goal of the hour of code is to introduce elementary school students to fundamental coding principles. Therefore, we invited seventh and eighth graders to our event. The approximate number of participants was around 30, and our group used both Azerbaijani and English to communicate and explain concepts.
            The event took place at 13:00 on November 11th. During the hour, we provided a brief overview of ADA University, demonstrated Code.org puzzles, and captured some truly captivating photographs and videos. We concluded our event with a question-and-answer session. Students inquired about ADA university, effective coding techniques, and programming languages and principles. Students that engaged actively in the event received gifts from us. As you can recognize from videos and photos students enjoyed and liked this event and were very engaged. We are quite pleased of our team for successfully executing our event and representing ADA university, as these children are our future and our future "special forces" in various fields.</p><br>
